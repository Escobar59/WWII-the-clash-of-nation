Narrator~~ Once in the decombres of Chelmno, the same smell returns to your nose. You will discover again the camp which is exactly the same as the first. Same infrastructure, same horror. You can find papers that say, “The Jews of the raid were taken to the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Chelmno camps”.

Another one says, “A problem has arisen because of the American advance: the Jews have all been deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp”. 

After that, you head towards Auschwitz.
