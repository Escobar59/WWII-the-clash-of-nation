Narrator~~ You manage to get down by entering the Japanese building yourself, your boss and 3 other people.

Chief~~ Soldiers start cleaning the stern of the submarine shooting down the submariners attacking you while continuing to advance towards the bow of the building.

Narrator~~ Once there you can see the last resident of this submarine about to end his life your leader rushing him to prevent him disarm and capture. You can see on the localization instruments that the foreign object starts from.

******* Congratulations you captured a submarine and a submariner the Japanese are retreating. ********
