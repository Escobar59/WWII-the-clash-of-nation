Teammate~~ Thanks, kid, thanks to your genius idea, you saved us all one by one. I've never seen anything like it !

Narrator~~ You handled it with great skill. Being able to shoot the bomb with your rifle made it explode before impact. Every French army member thanks you for that. With information from various French soldiers, you understand that a newly dug secret path leads directly to an enemy trench. The information about their bases is crucial. Once there, you realize that only enemy soldiers are present. What do you want to do?

1. Go back to your teammates?

2. Disguise yourself as an enemy soldier?
