German Soldier~~ Hey, man, give me the grenade; I'm going to throw it at those damn French people I see over there, give it to me, damn it!!

Narrator~~ To avoid blowing your cover, you decide to give the soldier the grenade he asked for. He throws the grenade at your teammates, who all perish in the explosion. After this tragedy, you hold your head high for your family and all those who believe in you. After a long walk, you arrive at a Nazi military camp and find a hidden book in one of the officer's offices. 

Thanks to this, maybe the war will turn in your favor.
