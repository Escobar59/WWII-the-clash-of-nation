Narrator~~ Once you arrive at the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, you can see the same infrastructure as in the other camp just on a different scale.
By visiting the camp you can see the same sequence of rooms. Once arrived in an archive room, you can discover information on deportations, such as that of a roundup that was sent here because of the Americans but which did not succeed in reaching its final destinations. You can also see the rules put in place for the camp guards, but nothing interesting ,the rest ended in flames.

You decide to return to your base with the tracks you found in France, the United States and a Stalingrad.

Once arrived the general welcomes you indicating the end of the war, thanks to the documents you brought back.

All the soldiers do it in joy and good humor. But you know that war crimes have been committed and that the fight against antisemitism does not stop while the perpetrators of these crimes are still free.

******** Felicitation you survived the war. ********
