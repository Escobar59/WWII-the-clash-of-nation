Narrator~~ Once in the lifeboat, you close your eyes for 2 seconds in order to regain your spirits but reopening them, you see that you are in the water. The ropes certainly gave way because of the many bad weather that crossed, But thinking about it you realize that you are drifting away from the conflict but also from Hawaii unfortunately you see a squadron of Japanese aircraft that fire on your small ship.
